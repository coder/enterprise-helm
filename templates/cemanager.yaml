# The following describes the Kubernetes deployment of the Coder Enterprise
# manager. The general setup is as follows:
#   - A namespace contains all the relevant resources for Coder Enterprise.
#   - A deployment describes the configuration of the manager container.
#   - A service is created to route requests to the manager pod.
#   - A service account (along with a Role and Role binding) is created to grant
#     the manager the necessary permissions to administer environments.
